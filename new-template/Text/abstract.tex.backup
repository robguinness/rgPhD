This thesis examines the topic of context awareness for navigation applications. Context can be defined as a computer's ability to understand the situation or context in which it is operating. In particular, we are interested in how context awareness can be used to understand the situation and needs of people using mobile computers, such as smartphones. There are many potential applications of context awareness, but this thesis focuses on applications related to navigation. For example, if a smartphone-based navigation system can understand when a user is walking, driving a car, or riding a train, then it can adapt its navigation algorithms to improve positioning performance.

We argue that the primary method avaialable for generating context awareness is machine learning. Machine learning is, in fact, a collection of many different algorithms and techniques for developing ``computer systems that automatically improve their performance through experience'' \cite{Mitchell1990}. This thesis examines systematically the ability of existing algorithms from machine learning to endow computing systems with context awareness. Specifically, we apply machine learning techniques to tackle three different tasks relating to context awareness and having applications to the field of navigation:  (1) to recognize the mode of motion that a smartphone user is undergoing outdoors and (2) to recognize the activity of a smartphone user in
an indoor office environment, and (3) to determine the optimal path of a ship travelling through ice-covered waters. The diversity of these tasks was chosen intentionally to demonstrate the breadth of problems emcompassed by the topic of context awareness.

During the course of studying context awareness, we adopted two conceptual ``frameworks,'' which we find useful for the purpose of solidifying the abstract concepts of context and context awareness. The first such framework is based strongly on a
