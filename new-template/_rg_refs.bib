  Abstract                 = {A revolution is under way. In recent years, Google's autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on American highways and IBM's Watson trounced the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies -- with hardware, software, and networks at their core -- will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee -- two thinkers at the forefront of their field -- reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds, from lawyers to truck drivers, will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress. - Publisher. This book takes a look into the future of business, work, and the economy in a digital world. In recent years, computers have learned to diagnose diseases, drive cars, and win at Jeopardy!. Advances like these have created unprecedented economic bounty, but in their wake median income has stagnated and the share of the population with jobs has fallen. In this book the authors reveal the technological forces driving this reinvention of the economy and chart a path toward future prosperity. They describe how humans will have to keep pace with machines in order to become prosperous in the future and identify strategies and policies for business and individuals to use to combine digital processing power with human ingenuity. -- From book jacket.},

  Abstract                 = {Geospatial computing includes utilizing computing devices and sensors to acquire, process, analyze, manage, and visualize geospatial data, which users can then interact with via a large variety of smart geospatial applications. Geospatial computing is a computational-demanding task, in terms of computation power, data storage capacity, and memory space. Therefore, it has primarily been performed on non-mobile computers. Recent developments allow smartphones to meet many of the demanded requirements for geospatial computing. This book addresses the topic of geospatial computing in smartphones, including positioning, mobile Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and smart mobile applications. You are provided with aspects related to positioning methods, as well as solutions for geospatial data acquisition, processing, and visualization. This resource also covers various aspects of the application technologies, such as context detection and context intelligence.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents an indoor navigation solution combining physical motion recognition with WLAN positioning on a smart phone. Orientationindependent features are extracted from vertical and horizontal components of acceleration. The simple features such as the mean of horizontal acceleration, the variance of acceleration magnitude, and the variance of horizontal acceleration are selected as the nodes in a decision tree. Six common motion modes during indoor navigation, e.g., static, standing with hand swinging, normal walking with holding the phone in hand, normal walking with hand swinging, fast walking, and U-turning are detected. A fingerprinting based WLAN positioning approach offers the headings and initial positions for pedestrian dead reckoning with about 10 seconds interval. The velocities for six motion modes are trained by five testers and applied in the dead reckoning during the WLAN positioning gap. Test results indicate that the motion mode is recognized correctly in 95% of test cases. The field test shows 4.6m horizontal mean error for motion recognition assisted indoor wireless positioning.},
